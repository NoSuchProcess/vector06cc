 * Got rid of priority encoder in peripheral_data_in bus: this fixed some timing issues

 A construct like this unwraps into a loooong cascade:
   {{{
always peripheral_data_in = ~vv55int_oe_n ? vv55int_odata :
			vi53_rden ? vi53_odata : 
			floppy_rden ? floppy_odata : 
			~vv55pu_oe_n ? vv55pu_odata : 8'hFF;
}}}
 I tried a more linear and clearly defined selector and it seems to be working nicely:
   {{{
always
	case ({~vv55int_oe_n, vi53_rden, floppy_rden, ~vv55pu_oe_n}) 
		4'b1000: peripheral_data_in <= vv55int_odata;
		4'b0100: peripheral_data_in <= vi53_odata;
		4'b0010: peripheral_data_in <= floppy_odata;
		4'b0001: peripheral_data_in <= vv55pu_odata;
		default: peripheral_data_in <= 8'hFF;
	endcase
}}}
 There are plenty of constructs like the former one in vector06cc, but I'm not sure if many of them are worth replacing. SRAM multiplexer, for one, definitely wants some attention, even though there are no apparent problems with it yet.
