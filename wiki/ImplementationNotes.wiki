Clock distribution:
 * clk24 is the master clock, also VGA pixel clock 
 * ce12 (12MHz) is 512 pixel mode pixel clock (PAL)
 * ce6 (6MHz) is the pixel/ram address clock
 * ce3 (3MHz) this is the main CPU clock enable
 * ce3v (3MHz) is unused --> floppy CPU boohoo
 * video_slice is high when video adapter wants RAM
 * pipe_ab is an internal signal in the video controller, invisible in this short simulation
 * timer_vi53_ce is the slow 1.5MHz clock enable for 8253 soundnik
